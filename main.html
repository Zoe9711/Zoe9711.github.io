            The Greeks had no single term to express what we mean by the word “life.” They used two terms that, although traceable to a common etymological root, are semantically and morphologically distinct:<br /> <br />
            βῐ́ος, which indicated the form or way of living proper to an individual or a group.<br />
            <br />
            And ζωή, which expressed the simple fact of living common to all living beings.

            - Giorgio Agamben. Homo Sacer. Il potere sovrano e la vita nuda
        </p>

        <p class="biopolitics">
            The term biopolitics is a philosophical concept of various definitions, one of which used by French philosopher Michel Foucault is “a new technology of power”, emerging in the late eighteenth century, that “deals with the population, with the population as political problem, as a problem that is at once scientific and political, as a biological problem and as power’s problem” (Foucault 245). It may be understood as a practice of “supervision over the disciplines of the body and the regulations of the population” by institutions and states to foster and sustain life and as a political rationality that now carefully supplants the old sovereign power dominated by individuals “to take life or let live” (Foucault 138). To achieve such subjugation and surveillance of bodies and populations, a series of techniques defined as biopower, such as the prison system and the issuing of birth certificate to each individual when born, are employed to “insert human bodies into the machinery of production and the adjustment of the phenomena of population to economic processes.”

        <p class="biopolitics">
            As emphasized by Foucault, biopower is also “an indispensable element in the development of capitalism” (Foucault 140-141).
        </p>

        <p class="biopolitics">
            Foucault presents that, following the end of famine and epidemics through the rapid development of agriculture and economic productivity in the eighteenth century, “different fields of knowledge concerned with life in general, the improvement of agricultural techniques and the observations  and measures relative to man’s life and survival” all steered towards a common realization that control over life would be necessary in order to foster life. This was when, reciprocally, the disciplining of human bodies and the subjugation and supervision of populations became a problem of sovereign power. As politics realized the importance of its control over biological being and thus integrated biological life into discussion, men began to learn what it meant to be a living being through mechanisms of power.

        <p class="biopolitics">
            Such a drastic turn from Aristotle’s definition of man as “a living animal with the additional capacity for a political existence,” as understood by Foucault, to “an animal whose politics places his existence as a living being in question” results in the determination of the meaning of people’s biological being through their political existence, by which their legibility and visibility in society could then be effortlessly altered through institutional practices (Foucault 142-144). Under the impact of such integration of biological life into politics and the respective governing, societies are often forced to reexamine their understanding of biological beings, which is then reshaped and redefined accordingly to align with that of the institutions, usually leading to segregation and hierarchization of groups of people with one group superior or inferior to another.

        <p class="biopolitics">
            Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, inspired by both Michel Foucault’s discourse of biopolitics and Hannah Arendt’s analysis of the process that brings biological life into the political scene, discovers the incompleteness of both of their theories. As Arendt did not take a biopolitical perspective in her analysis of totalitarian power, Foucault did not “dwell on the exemplary places of modern biopolitics: the concentration camp and the structure of the great totalitarian states of the twentieth century” (Agamben 5-6). Moreover, Agamben questions the relation between politics and life and believes that the understanding of “additional capacity” in Foucault’s interpretation of Aristotle is problematic. Introducing a new framework, he employs the Greeks’ definition of life, ζωή̄ and βῐ́ος, with the former referring to the simple fact of living common to all creatures and the latter “the form or way of living proper to an individual or a group.” 
        </p>

        <p class="biopolitics">
            Within the limited understanding presented in this project, Agamben emphasizes the “inclusive exclusion of ζωή̄,” where the achievement of politically qualified life (βῐ́ος), and because of which the constitution of Western politics, simultaneously excludes and includes bare life (ζωή̄). As he argued, “politics were the place in which life had to transform itself into good life and in which what had to be politicized were always already bare life.” Taking into account this characteristic of inclusive exclusion of bare life in politics, Agamben believes that Foucault’s thesis on biopolitics is incomplete and that “what characterizes modern politics is not simply the fact that life as such becomes a principal object of the projections and calculations of State power.” Instead, it is a much more complicated and ambiguous situation in which “the realm of bare life gradually begins to coincide with the political realm, and exclusion and inclusion, outside an inside, βῐ́ος and ζωή̄, right and fact, enter into a zone of irreducible indistinction” (Agamben 7-9).
        </p>

        <p class="biopolitics">
            Furthermore, Agamben himself dwells on the exemplary places in his exploration of the relation between life and politics through the problem of refugees, influenced by Arendt’s analysis of imperialism. He argues that the refugee is a representation of the separation between man and citizen, rights of man and rights of citizen, and bare life and politically qualified life, and is “the first and only real appearance of rights outside the fiction of the citizen that always covers them over.” And such separation makes it difficult to define refugees politically and consequently reduces them to bare life that is only and can only be made the object of aid and protection by humanitarianism. It is also such separation, together with that between humanitarianism and politics, that results in the failure of organizations and individual states to resolve refugee problems or even “confront it adequately” (Agamben 81-85). Therefore, as Agamben concludes, the refugee must be considered for what he is, with the understanding in which “bare life is no longer separated and excepted, either in the state order or in the figure of human rights” (Agamben 86).
